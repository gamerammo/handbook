# CONTRIBUTING
On behalf of the Gamer Ammo entity and the community behind us, I would like to express the upmost gratitude. If all you do is fix a typo or if you take on the start of any of our major [issues](https://github.com/gamerammo/handbook/issues) you are providing invaluable efforts to our cause that we cannot thank you enough for. That being said, below you will find the details of the stylistic approach to the code and repository that we've invisioned for the end product. Please keep in mind that we are continuing to clean up and readjust our own commits up to this point to adhere to this as well. Feel free to include editing anything we've uploaded to adhere to these guidelines as well.
